This project aims to develop 1-channel "drum" that emits a frequency based on the strength of a tap, which is tracked with an accelerometer on-board the Artix A7 FPGA. A "pianoEffects" class was also developed to map a computer keyboard's keys to piano keys, creating a electronic piano. Both the "drum" and piano display simple graphical effects using the VGA protocol.

In order to create this project, an SoC using the Artix A7 FPGA and Microblaze MCU was developed during the course. Within this repository, however, are only the files that contain source code developed from scratch.
